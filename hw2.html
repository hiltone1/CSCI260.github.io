<h1>Homework 2</h1>
<h3>Food Events</h3>
<p>For the Food events project would we be using services to actually send messages to phone numbers to test the notifications?</p>
<p>I personally would do job organization because it seems less complicated. They both will have their levels of difficulty I'm sure. If we are using an actual service to
  send phone text messages in Food events I would want to work with that. I'm interested to see how that would work.</p>
<h4>Time Management and Estimaation</h4>
<p>Time management during a project is important. When a business asks for something to be implemented there are a lot of assumptions. When these assumptuions are made they should be documented and
  reviewed by both parties. These assumpitions can affect the amount of work that is being compleleted in a certain time period. For example, a certian implementaion may be reqiured in the project
  and it must be researched. The assumption that is made is the amount of time spent researching. Are the top five solutions researched or are all solutions tested in research? That is why there
  are specifics that are communitcated to prevent the assumptions.</p>
