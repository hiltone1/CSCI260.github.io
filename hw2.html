<h1>Homework 2</h1>
<h3>Food Evets</h3>
<p>For the Food events project whould we be using services to actually send messages to phone numbers to test the notifications?<p>
<p>I personally would do job orgainization becuase it seems less complicated. They both will have their levels of difficulty I'm sure. If we are using an actual service to
  send phone text messages in Food events I would want to work with that. I'm interested to see how that would work.<p>
