<h1>Homework 1</h1>
<h3>Entropy</h3>
<p>Entropy in software development is important. It is not something that I previously considered when writing code. In pervios projects I could have gone back through and cleaned up code and
  removed nethods that had no use. I did enjoy the analogy about the broken windows in a city to keep it in better shape. I imagine that rookie programmers experince software rot more than professinal
  programmers. I hope to avoid software rot in my future projects now that I am more aware of it.
